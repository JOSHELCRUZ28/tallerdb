1: 
List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
```sql
SELECT name  
FROM world  
WHERE population > (  
    SELECT population  
    FROM world  
    WHERE name = 'Russia'  
);

```

2: 
Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE continent='Europe' AND
gdp/population>(
SELECT gdp/population 
FROM world 
WHERE name= 'United Kingdom'
)
```
3: 
List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
```sql
SELECT name, continent  
FROM world  
WHERE continent IN (  
    SELECT continent  
    FROM world 
    WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia')  
)  
ORDER BY name; 
```

4: 
Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.
```sql
SELECT name, population  
FROM world 
WHERE population > (  
    SELECT population  
    FROM world 
    WHERE name = 'United Kingdom'  
)  
AND population < (  
    SELECT population  
    FROM world
    WHERE name = 'Germany'  
);  

```

5: 
Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

### Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

The format should be Name, Percentage for example:
```sql
SELECT name,  
       CONCAT(ROUND((population * 100.0 / (SELECT population
FROM world WHERE
 name = 'Germany')), 0), '%') AS percentage  
FROM world 
WHERE continent = 'Europe'; 
```

6: 
Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
```sql
SELECT name  
FROM world  
WHERE gdp > (  
    SELECT MAX(gdp)  
    FROM world 
    WHERE continent = 'Europe'  
)  
AND gdp IS NOT NULL;  
```

7: 
### Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.

Using correlated subqueries
```sql
SELECT continent, name, area  
FROM world c1  
WHERE area = (  
    SELECT MAX(area)  
    FROM world c2  
    WHERE c1.continent = c2.continent  
);  
```

8: 
### List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
```sql
SELECT continent, name  
FROM world c1  
WHERE name = (  
    SELECT MIN(name)  
    FROM world c2  
    WHERE c1.continent = c2.continent  
);  
```

9.
### Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
```sql
SELECT name, continent, population  
FROM world 
WHERE continent IN (  
    SELECT continent  
    FROM world  
    GROUP BY continent  
    HAVING MAX(population) <= 25000000  
);  
```

10: 
### Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
```sql
SELECT c1.name, c1.continent  
FROM world c1  
WHERE c1.population > 3 * (  
    SELECT SUM(c2.population)  
    FROM world c2  
    WHERE c2.continent = c1.continent  
    AND c2.name <> c1.name  
);
```
